Protocracy
=========

A prototype of democracy. For representative democracy just ain't good enough any more.

The basis of protocracy is formed in the idea of giving each individual equal influence in a shared government model. The system should be robust enough to withstand manipulation or corruption. At the same time it must not become a burden and a time sink for the individual.

At the heart of protocracy is the singular vote, placed by an individual. Intricately linked to this vote, is the motion the vote affects. The system must serve to distribute the motions to the voters and gather their votes.
